=> Personal Non-Compatibility (The "Wrong Fit")
This happens when the college is "incompatible" with 
you as a student—culturally, academically, or financially.

Placement Failure: "Non-compatible" often means a 
tier-3 or tier-4 college with no industry connections. You may 
graduate with a valid degree but remain unemployed because 
the college lacked a placement cell.

Skill Stagnation: If you are a high-performing student in a 
low-rigor environment, your growth will plateau. 
Conversely, if you are a creative learner in a 
rote-memorization-heavy institution, you may face 
academic burnout.

Financial Loss (ROI): Spending ₹10–15 Lakhs on a 
private engineering/management college that yields a 
job paying ₹3 Lakhs/year is a negative Return on 
Investment (ROI) that takes years to recover from.
